# Pull Requests and Code Contributions

I'm not currently accepting external pull requests to ExtendFS at this time due to potential legal complexities with accepting external code contributions while publishing the app on the App Store. Pull requests will be closed without review.

I may revisit this in the future if there is interest, such as by making a CLA or a license exception. If you want to show such interest, feel free to create a discussion in the discussions tab letting me know (please look in case someone else has already created one, first, and upvote it if so).
